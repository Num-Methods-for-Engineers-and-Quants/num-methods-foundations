# 📘 Numerical Methods for Engineers and Quants

> **A practical Python series for mastering core numerical methods used in both infrastructure modeling and quantitative finance.**

---

## 🧭 Overview

This repository series bridges the gap between **engineering math** and **quantitative modeling**, showing how classical numerical techniques apply in both domains.

Whether you're solving water main break equations or optimizing portfolios, numerical methods form the **computational backbone** of modern engineering and financial analytics.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

Each module includes:
- 🔢 **Mathematical breakdown** of the method  
- 🧠 **Conceptual explanation** for both engineers and quants  
- 🐍 **Python implementation** from scratch  
- 📈 **Practical application** in either civil or financial context  

| Module | Method | Engineering Use | Quant/Finance Use |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 01     | Root Finding (Bisection, Newton-Raphson) | Solving flow balance equations | IRR/Yield estimation, implied vol |
| 02     | Linear Systems (Gaussian, LU) | Pipe network pressures, structural analysis | Solving multi-factor models |
| 03     | Interpolation (Lagrange, Least Squares) | Material data fitting, soil compaction | Price curve estimation |
| 04     | Integration (Trapezoidal, Simpson's) | Volume/area calculation | Option pricing approximations |
| 05     | ODEs (Euler, Runge-Kutta) | Reservoir simulation, dynamic systems | Black-Scholes solver, time-series modeling |
